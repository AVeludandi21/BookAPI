## About the Book API

- The Book API is a web service built with ASP.NET Core that lets you manage a list of books.
- It supports basic CRUD operations: you can add, view, update, and delete books using HTTP requests.
- Each book has an ID, title, publisher, and subject. The API checks that the data you send is valid.
- All book data is stored in memory, so it resets when the application restarts (no database is used).
- The API also includes a weather forecast endpoint that returns random weather data for the next 5 days.
- There are unit tests included to make sure the API works as expected.
- You interact with the API using endpoints like `/api/book` for books and `/weatherforecast` for weather data.
